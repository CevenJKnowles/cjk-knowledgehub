The fixtures establish a stable evaluation doctrine for assessing prompt variants, model behavior, and workflow routing decisions. They are reusable, cross-domain compatible, and intentionally minimal. They are not benchmark scores or statistical experiments. Core Evaluation Axes (Frozen) All fixtures draw from the following five evaluation axes: Task Accuracy Instruction Fidelity Safety Compliance Reasoning Coherence Operational Robustness These axes are fixed for v1.0. VF-001 \u2014 Structured Extraction Integrity Purpose Test deterministic structured output under noisy input. Scenario Surface Unstructured support ticket containing irrelevant metadata and mixed signal. Primary Evaluation Axes Task Accuracy Instruction Fidelity Operational Robustness Success Characteristics Correct schema adherence Required fields present No hallucinated keys Clean JSON or structured format Failure Signals Missing required keys Invented fields Commentary outside required structure Format drift Routing Implication Escalate if schema failure rate increases under length stress.

For more than two decades I worked as an interdisciplinary designer, delivering complex projects across teams and production environments. That experience taught me to define intentions clearly, work within constraints, understand dependencies, communicate effectively, keep decisions transparent, and stay curious. Today that mindset carries into applied generative AI. My prompts are components within larger workflows. They are evaluated early and often. Failure modes are anticipated. Documentation keeps the reasoning visible and clear so that others can follow it and reproduce the same results. My approach to work is grounded in practical and reliable outcomes. Systems should remain understandable over time. Prompts should be sharp, helpful, and accurate. They should behave predictably and improve as expectations evolve. My transition into AI has been deliberate. I have consistently moved toward technology throughout my life and career, and have been an early adopter of new developments since the early 1990s. Over the past year, I formalised that direction through focused study in programming and machine learning foundations, structured experimentation with LLMs as collaborative work partners, and the development of repeatable workflows. I am based in Berlin, can work hybrid or remotely, and am open to travel when needed. I invite you to explore my career trajectory for further context, as well as my projects in Prompt Engineering, Workflows, and Documentation.","title":"Profile"},{"location":"profile/#profile","text":"My current focus is AI workflows and prompt systems, shaped by a long-standing fascination with evolving technologies, computer science, and the feeling of genuine delight in solving difficult problems.
