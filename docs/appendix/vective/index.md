# Vective (Fictional Context Package)

Vective is a fictional B2B SaaS company used as a stable scenario environment across selected KnowledgeHub artifacts.

It exists solely to provide consistent product context for prompt engineering case studies, workflow demonstrations, and documentation examples.

Vective is not a real company, not a product proposal, and not a system architecture.

It functions strictly as a constraint model for applied demonstrations within this portfolio.

## Source Pack

The Vective source pack contains the shared input material referenced across relevant artifacts.

It exists to ensure consistency and eliminate duplication between case studies.

The source pack has no independent purpose outside the artifacts that reference it.
