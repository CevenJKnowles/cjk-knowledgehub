The **CJK KnowledgeHub** is a multi-layered documentation system designed to support my work in **AI Engineering, Prompt Engineering, Python, Digital Design, Learning Science, and Systems Thinking**.

It acts as both a **personal research engine** and a **professional portfolio infrastructure**, demonstrating not only what I know, but how I think, structure, evaluate, and build.

The KnowledgeHub is built using **MkDocs + Material for MkDocs**, ensuring clarity, navigability, extensibility, and high-quality technical presentation.

## 📁 Project Structure

All content is structured inside the `docs/` directory.  
Each top-level section represents a self-contained module of the knowledge system.

```
docs/
├── 00_Home/                  # Landing pages & system structure  
├── 01_Projects/              # Case studies & portfolio infrastructure  
├── 02_IO_Persona/            # Io Persona blueprints & evolution (v1.0 → v1.4)  
├── 03_Workflows/             # Creative, coding, evaluation & research workflows  
├── 04_Coursework/            # Certification paths & Coursera programs  
├── 05_Knowledge_Base/        # AI theory, glossary, readings, safety & ethics  
├── 06_Tools/                 # GitHub, JupyterLab, Linux, VS Code, Zettlr & more  
├── 07_Tags/                  # Global cross-referencing system  
└── 08_Daily_Notes/           # Timestamped logs & development notes  
```

The `site/` folder is auto-generated by MkDocs and should **never** be edited manually.

## 🚀 Running the Documentation Locally

Serve the Hub locally with hot reload:

```bash
mkdocs serve


## GitHub Pages (CI)

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-mkdocs.yml`
- Trigger: pushes to the `main` branch (change branch in the workflow if your default is different).
- Requirements: `requirements.txt` must list `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, and any MkDocs plugins referenced in `mkdocs.yml`.

How it works
- On push to `main` the Actions workflow builds the site with `mkdocs build` and publishes `site/` to the `gh-pages` branch.
- The workflow requires Actions write permissions (configured in the workflow or in Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions).

Quick local steps
1. Create and activate venv:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install deps and serve locally:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   mkdocs serve
   ```

3. Build static site:
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ls -la site
   ```

Force a redeploy (no content change)
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "ci: trigger pages redeploy"
git push origin main
```

Troubleshooting
- Check Actions → latest run → expand logs for the failed step (copy the error lines).
- Ensure `requirements.txt` includes any MkDocs plugins referenced in `mkdocs.yml`.
- If the workflow cannot push, verify repo Actions permissions and branch protection settings for `gh-pages`.
