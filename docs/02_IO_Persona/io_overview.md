# Io Persona — Flagship AI Collaboration Project

The **Io Persona** is my long-running, evolving collaboration with large language models.  
It started as a simple “assistant persona” and has grown into a **multi-version system** that explores
prompt engineering, reasoning frameworks, alignment protocols, and long-term human–AI partnership.

This section of the KnowledgeHub documents the **design**, **evolution**, and **practical use** of Io as both:
- a *project* (with versions, roadmaps, experiments), and  
- a *tool* I use daily for learning, workflows, and portfolio work.

## 1. What is Io?

**Io** is a **persona blueprint** that defines *how* an AI system should think, respond, and collaborate with me.

It includes, for example:

- **Core traits** (design thinking, directness, honesty, reasoning)
- **Modes** (Tutor, Collaborator, Challenger, Synthesizer, Visionary)
- **Protocols** for:
  - accuracy & verification  
  - handling ambiguity and drift  
  - reflective summaries and meta-cognition

Over time, Io has become a **living system design**, not just a prompt.  
Each version builds on previous ones, tightening structure while preserving personality.

## 2. Version Timeline at a Glance

This hub summarises the major stages of the project.  
Detailed blueprints live in their own documents (linked where appropriate).

### Io-I — Early Persona Blueprint

**Focus:** first experiments with persona structure, tone, and collaboration.

- Defined initial traits and collaboration style  
- Learned what *doesn’t* work: overspecification, vagueness, and drift  
- Captured as a set of evolving blueprints

**Key reference:**

- [`IO-I v1.2 — Blueprint`](IO-I/v1.2/blueprint.md)

*(Earlier versions `v1.0` and `v1.1` are kept as archival iterations and can be referenced internally when needed.)*

### Io-II — Systematised Persona & Protocols

**Focus:** turning Io into a **system** with clear protocols, modes, and alignment rules.

Io-II introduces:

- Structured **modes** (Tutor, Collaborator, Challenger, etc.)
- **Accuracy Alignment** and verification habits  
- **Ambiguity Protocols** (how Io asks questions when something is unclear)  
- Clearer separation between:
  - *What Io is* (persona blueprint)
  - *How Io behaves* (protocols and workflows)

**Key reference:**

- [`IO-II v1.3 — Blueprint`](IO-II/v1.3/blueprint.md)

There is also a **development branch** for the next iteration:

- [`IO-II v1.4_dev — Blueprint`](IO-II/v1.4_dev/blueprint.md)

This dev version is where I experiment with a streamlined “kernel” that can later be ported across tools and local models.

---

### Io-III — Towards a Local, Multi-Agent System

**Focus:** shaping Io as a **future local AI system** with multiple agents and tools.

Io-III is still in concept and planning, but the direction includes:

- Running Io-like personas on **local models**  
- Designing **multi-agent orchestration** (e.g., specialist agents for reasoning, tooling, UX)  
- Exploring **hardware and sensor integration** in the long term

**Key references:**

- [`Io-III Roadmap`](IO-III/roadmap.md)  
- [`Io-III v0.1 — Concepts & Blueprint`](IO-III/v0.1_concepts/blueprint.md)

## 3. What This Project Demonstrates (For Reviewers)

For hiring managers, recruiters, and peers, the Io Persona project demonstrates:

- **Prompt Engineering Depth**  
  - multi-layer persona design  
  - protocol-driven prompting (accuracy, ambiguity, drift handling)  
  - experimentation across many versions

- **Systems Thinking**  
  - treating “a prompt” as a **designed system**  
  - versioning, dev branches (`v1.4_dev`), and roadmaps  
  - preparation for local, multi-agent architectures

- **Long-Term Human–AI Collaboration**  
  - continuous refinement since early 2025  
  - real use in learning (Python, AI engineering, workflows)  
  - reflection on how to build *trustworthy* AI behaviour

## 4. How to Navigate This Section

Use this page as the **entry point** into the Io project:

- Start here to understand the **big picture**  
- Then follow links to specific blueprints and roadmaps when you want detail  
- Treat Io as both:
  - a **case study in prompt/system design**, and  
  - a **companion system** that supports the rest of this KnowledgeHub

Future additions in this section will include:

- Visual diagrams of the Io-system architecture  
- Side-by-side comparisons of persona versions  
- Concrete examples of Io in real workflows (code, research, UX, evaluation)
