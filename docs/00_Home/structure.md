# KnowledgeHub Structure  
*A hybrid overview of the CJK KnowledgeHub architecture*

The CJK KnowledgeHub is organized to balance **clarity for external readers** and **depth for internal development**.  
This page provides both:  
- a **high-level map** of the site, and  
- curated internal tree views for the most important areas of work.

---

## 🏛️ 1. Home  
**Directory:** `00_Home/`  

Contains the entry points to the entire KnowledgeHub:
- **index.md** — The landing page and overview  
- **instructions.md** — How to navigate and use the KnowledgeHub  
- **structure.md** — This site structure document  

This section acts as the “front door” for visitors and reviewers.

---

## 🧩 2. Featured Work — Projects  
**Directory:** `01_Projects/`  

This section showcases work that is most relevant to hiring managers and collaborators.

### High-Level Contents
- **Prompt Engineering Portfolio Hub**  
- **Case Studies**  
- **Conversational AI Hub**  
- **Portfolio Infrastructure Hub**

### Curated Internal Structure
```
