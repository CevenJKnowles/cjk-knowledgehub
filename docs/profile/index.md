# Profile

My current focus is AI workflows and prompt systems, shaped by a long-standing fascination with evolving technologies, computer science, and the genuine satisfaction of solving difficult problems.

For more than two decades I worked as an interdisciplinary designer, delivering complex projects across teams and production environments. That experience taught me to define intentions clearly, work within constraints, understand dependencies, communicate effectively, keep decisions transparent, and stay curious.

Today that mindset carries into applied generative AI. My prompts are components within larger workflows. They are evaluated early and often. Failure modes are anticipated. Documentation keeps the reasoning visible and clear so that others can follow it and reproduce the same results.

My approach to work is grounded in practical and reliable outcomes. Systems should remain understandable over time. Prompts should be sharp, helpful, and accurate. They should behave predictably and improve as expectations evolve.

My transition into AI has been deliberate. I have consistently moved toward technology throughout my life and career, and have been an early adopter of new developments since the early 1990s. Over the past year, I formalised that direction through focused study in programming and machine learning foundations, structured experimentation with LLMs as collaborative work partners, and the development of repeatable workflows.

I am based in Berlin, can work hybrid or remotely, and am open to travel when needed. I invite you to explore my career trajectory for further context, as well as my projects in Prompt Engineering, Workflows, and Documentation.
