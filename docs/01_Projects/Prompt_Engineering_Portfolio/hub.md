# Prompt Engineering Portfolio — Project Hub

This section of the **CJK KnowledgeHub** is dedicated to my work in **prompt engineering**.  
It serves as the *project hub* for case studies, experiments, coursework integrations, and long-term systems like the Io Persona.

The goal of this hub is to show **how I think, design, and iterate** with large language models – not just final outputs.

## 1. What Lives in This Portfolio?

This portfolio gathers together:

- **Case Studies**  
  End-to-end explorations that highlight:
  - problem framing  
  - prompt design and iteration  
  - reasoning and verification strategies  
  - outcomes and reflections  

- **Patterns & Techniques**  
  Practical applications of prompt patterns such as:
  - Few-shot prompting  
  - Game-play, Template, Recipe, and Meta-language patterns  
  - Reasoning and evaluation workflows  

- **Systems & Workflows**  
  How I combine:
  - Io Persona  
  - prompt patterns  
  - external tools (JupyterLab, GitHub, etc.)  
  into repeatable workflows that can be used in real projects.

Over time, this hub will become the **main public-facing entry point** to my prompt engineering work.

## 2. Structure of This Section

The `Prompt_Engineering_Portfolio` folder is organised to support both **storytelling** and **internal iteration**:

- `hub.md`  
  → This page. High-level overview and navigation entry point.

- `backlog.md` *(internal working file)*  
  → List of ideas, future case studies, and experiments I plan to develop.

- `decisions.md` *(internal working file)*  
  → Design decisions, trade-offs, and rationale behind how I structure prompts, workflows, and this portfolio over time.

- `workflow_notes.md` *(internal working file)*  
  → Notes on prompt workflows, iteration loops, evaluation setups, and experiment logs.

These internal pages are not meant as polished case studies; they show the **thinking and planning** that sits behind the public-facing work.

## 3. Relationship to Vanderbilt Prompt Engineering Coursework

Many of the ideas and experiments here are grounded in the  
**Vanderbilt Prompt Engineering Specialization** (Coursera):

- Course 1 — *Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT*  
- Course 2 — *ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis*  
- Course 3 — *Trustworthy Generative AI*

I treat that coursework as:

- a **knowledge base** (patterns, frameworks, best practices), and  
- a **launch pad** for my own case studies, workflows, and Io Persona evolution.

Concrete course notes, tests, and sandbox prompts live under:

- `04_Coursework/Vanderbilt_Prompt_Engineering_Specialization/...`

This hub will reference that material selectively, focusing on **how I apply** those concepts in real work.

## 4. For Recruiters, Collaborators, and Reviewers

If you are evaluating my profile, this section is designed to demonstrate:

- **Practical Prompt Engineering Skill**
  - clear problem decomposition  
  - structured prompts and patterns  
  - iterative improvement instead of one-shot answers  

- **Reasoning & Verification Mindset**
  - awareness of hallucinations and model limits  
  - explicit verification steps and protocols  
  - use of tools (code, docs, tests) alongside language models  

- **Systemic Thinking**
  - connecting prompt design with Io Persona  
  - designing processes, not just isolated prompts  
  - building reusable workflows and documentation

Future additions will include:

- Fully written case studies  
- Side-by-side “prompt → iteration → outcome” breakdowns  
- Links into Io Persona blueprints where relevant

## 5. How to Navigate from Here

Use this hub as your **starting point**:

- For polished narratives → go to the **Case Studies** section from the main navigation.  
- For a peek into the thinking behind the scenes:
  - [`Backlog`](backlog.md)  
  - [`Decisions`](decisions.md)  
  - [`Workflow Notes`](workflow_notes.md)  

As the portfolio grows, this page will remain the **anchor** for everything related to Prompt Engineering in the CJK KnowledgeHub.
