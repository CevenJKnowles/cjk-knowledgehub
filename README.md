The **CJK KnowledgeHub** is a multi-layered documentation system designed to support my work in **AI Engineering, Prompt Engineering, Python, Digital Design, Learning Science, and Systems Thinking**.

It acts as both a **personal research engine** and a **professional portfolio infrastructure**, demonstrating not only what I know, but how I think, structure, evaluate, and build.

The KnowledgeHub is built using **MkDocs + Material for MkDocs**, ensuring clarity, navigability, extensibility, and high-quality technical presentation.

## 📁 Project Structure

All content is structured inside the `docs/` directory.  
Each top-level section represents a self-contained module of the knowledge system.

```
docs/
├── 00_Home/                  # Landing pages & system structure  
├── 01_Projects/              # Case studies & portfolio infrastructure  
├── 02_IO_Persona/            # Io Persona blueprints & evolution (v1.0 → v1.4)  
├── 03_Workflows/             # Creative, coding, evaluation & research workflows  
├── 04_Coursework/            # Certification paths & Coursera programs  
├── 05_Knowledge_Base/        # AI theory, glossary, readings, safety & ethics  
├── 06_Tools/                 # GitHub, JupyterLab, Linux, VS Code, Zettlr & more  
├── 07_Tags/                  # Global cross-referencing system  
└── 08_Daily_Notes/           # Timestamped logs & development notes  
```

The `site/` folder is auto-generated by MkDocs and should **never** be edited manually.
