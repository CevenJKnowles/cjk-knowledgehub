# CJK KnowledgeHub

Welcome to the CJK KnowledgeHub — my living workspace for learning, experimentation, and portfolio building in AI, prompt engineering, and digital systems design.

This site hosts my **projects, personas, workflows, coursework, and reference knowledge**. It’s both my personal lab notebook and the backbone of my future professional portfolio.

---

## What this hub is for

- **Documenting my journey** from beginner to working AI professional  
- **Building reusable workflows** for prompting, evaluation, and reasoning  
- **Capturing course notes and exercises** from my ongoing learning paths  
- **Designing and stress-testing the Io Persona**, my long-term AI collaborator concept  
- **Maintaining a structured knowledge base** I can grow and refine over time  

If you’re a reviewer, recruiter, or collaborator, this hub shows **how I think, how I organize complexity, and how I learn in public.**

## Featured Work

### Prompt Engineering Portfolio

This is the practical heart of the hub.

- **Hub:** high-level overview of current and planned portfolio work  
- **Backlog, decisions, and workflow notes:** how I choose, refine, and execute projects  
- Focus on:
  - Prompt pattern application in real tasks  
  - Evaluation and error-analysis workflows  
  - End-to-end prompting systems and documentation

### Io Persona — Flagship Project

The **Io Persona** is my long-term flagship: a designed AI “collaborator” with explicit protocols, modes, and evolution across versions (IO-I → IO-II → IO-III).

Inside this section you’ll find:

- **Overview:** the concept, purpose, and evolution timeline  
- **IO-I (v1.0–v1.2):** early experiments and blueprint drafts  
- **IO-II (v1.2–v1.4 dev):** current active persona with richer protocols and alignment rules  
- **IO-III (v0.1 concepts):** early thinking about future, multi-agent, local, and embodied directions  
- **Experiments:** scratchpads and test ideas that don’t yet belong in a formal blueprint  

This project connects **prompt engineering, AI safety/ethics, UX, and systems design** into one evolving artefact.

## Workflows & Systems

The **Workflows** section contains the practical “how I work” layer:

- **Code Notebooks:** notes on using notebooks and coding workflows  
- **Creative Workflows:** ideation, storytelling, and design flows  
- **Evaluation Workflows:** how I check quality, reason about errors, and iterate  
- **Prompting:** specific prompting flows and interaction patterns  
- **Research:** how I structure reading, note-taking, and synthesis  

These pages are about **repeatable processes**, not just final outputs.

`Workflows`

## Coursework & Learning Paths

I am currently working through several structured learning paths. The **Coursework** section tracks notes and artefacts from:

- **Google IT Automation with Python**  
- **IBM Generative AI Engineering Professional Certificate**  
- **Vanderbilt Prompt Engineering Specialization**  
- **Certificates overview** (completed achievements and status)  

You’ll find course-level hubs, module notes, prompt experiments, and test reflections — all focused on **retention, understanding, and practical application**.

`Coursework`

## Knowledge Base & Tools

### Knowledge Base

A curated set of topics I want to keep coming back to:

- **AI Concepts:** foundations, comparisons, and mental models  
- **Glossary:** terms I care about and how I define them  
- **Prompt Patterns:** pattern-level knowledge extracted from practice  
- **Reading Notes:** highlights and reflections from articles and papers  
- **Safety & Ethics:** trustworthy AI, risk thinking, and responsibility  

→ Navigate via:  
`Knowledge Base`

### Tools

The **Tools** section documents the ecosystem I’m building around my work:

- GitHub  
- JupyterLab  
- Linux notes  
- VS Code  
- Zettlr  
- marimo  
- Nextcloud  

Each page is meant as a **personal reference sheet**: setup steps, commands, usage patterns, and gotchas.

`Tools`

## Tags & Daily Notes

- **Tags:** a simple index for cross-cutting themes (topics that span multiple sections).  
- **Daily Notes:** time-stamped working notes, reflections, and scratch thinking for specific days.

These are the most “alive” parts of the hub — they show what I’m focusing on at any given time.

`Tags` and `Daily Notes`

## How to read this hub (for reviewers & recruiters)

If you’re here to understand how I work, a good path is:

1. **Start here (Home)** to understand the structure and intent  
2. Visit **Prompt Engineering Portfolio Hub** to see how I design and run projects  
3. Explore **Io Persona** to see thinking about AI collaboration and system design  
4. Skim **Coursework** to see my structured learning and test performance context  
5. Dip into **Knowledge Base** or **Tools** for depth in areas that interest you  

This hub is intentionally **work-in-progress**. The point is not perfection — it’s to show **clarity, structure, curiosity, and growth over time.**
